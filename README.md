# p1MapReduce
Project 1 of the Big Data course.

Has several maven projects with MapReduce functions for processing Twitter JSONs in the HDFS.

The graphs folder has the output after the MapRduce functions in .cvs files and a .txt file for the username count.

The graphs.html works in Firefox since it depends on local data and other browsers don't normally allow that type of access.
